Personality modeling in AI plays a crucial role in creating adaptive, relatable interactions by simulating human-like traits. Traditional models, such as the OCEAN Big Five, lack the depth required to represent a full spectrum of personality nuances. In this study, we enhance AI personality modeling by transitioning to Cattell’s 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, extending the range of traits represented. Our objectives are fourfold: we extend the Machine Personality Inventory (MPI) test to measure all 16 traits from the 16PF model, providing a comprehensive personality assessment; modify the P2 Prompting method to support targeted induction of each of these 16 traits; develop a technique to quantify the intensity of each trait's expression; and design an approach for inducing specific intensity levels across traits, allowing for precise personality manipulation. This work significantly broadens AI’s personality modeling capabilities, enabling more controlled and nuanced personality expression, which enhances application in diverse interaction contexts.
