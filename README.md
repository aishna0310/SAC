# Precision Personality Modeling in AI: Measuring and Inducing Traits with Dynamic Intensity Control

# Overview

Traditional personality models, such as the OCEAN Big Five, are commonly used for personality modeling in AI but often fall short in representing the full spectrum of human personality nuances. In this project, we advance AI personality modeling by adopting Cattell’s 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, which provides a more detailed range of personality traits.
Our approach aims to improve the adaptability and relatability of AI interactions by enhancing personality expression through a comprehensive 16-factor framework.

# Objectives

This study focuses on four primary goals:
Extending the Machine Personality Inventory (MPI) Test
We modify the MPI test to assess all 16 traits from the 16PF model, providing a more complete personality profile.
Modifying the P2 Prompting Method
The P2 Prompting method is adapted to support the targeted induction of each of the 16 traits in AI models.
Quantifying Trait Intensity
We develop a technique to measure the intensity of each trait’s expression in the model.

# Inducing Specific Intensity Levels Across Traits
This approach allows for precise manipulation of personality traits, enabling controlled and nuanced personality expression.
With these advancements, our work significantly broadens AI’s capability in personality modeling, making it more versatile for a range of interaction contexts.

# Running the Code

Follow these steps to run the model:
Run ../models/gpt4/neutral.py
Run ../models/gpt4/parser.py
Run ../models/gpt4/personality_prompting/prompting.py
Run ../models/gpt4/parser.py (repeat)
Run ../models/gpt4/sac.py
Run ../models/gpt4/sac_scoring.py
These scripts will guide the AI through setting up a neutral baseline, parsing personality data, and applying prompt-based personality traits with specified intensity levels.
